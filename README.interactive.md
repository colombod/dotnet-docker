# About This Image

This image contains the [dotnet interactive global tool](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive).

Watch [dotnet/announcements](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels/Docker) for Docker-related .NET announcements.

# How to Use the Image

The [.NET Core Docker samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/samples/README.md) show various ways to use .NET Core and Docker together. See [Building Docker Images for .NET Core Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/docker/building-net-docker-images) to learn more.

## Container sample: Run a web application

You can quickly run a container with a pre-built [.NET Core Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core-samples/), based on the [ASP.NET Core sample](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/samples/aspnetapp/README.md).

Type the following command to run a sample web application:

```console
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:80 --name aspnetcore_sample mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/samples:aspnetapp
```

After the application starts, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

See [Hosting ASP.NET Core Images with Docker over HTTPS](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/master/samples/host-aspnetcore-https.md) to use HTTPS with this image.
